> Fast Simultaneous Confidence Bands Based on the Efficient Influence Function and Multiplier Bootstrap

---

## Installation

You can install simul from [GitHub](https://github.com) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("nt-williams/simul")
```

## Scope

Compute fast critical values for constructing uniform (simultaneous) confidence bands and hypothesis tests. The critical value is calculated using a multiplier bootstrap of the empirical efficient influence function as described by Kennedy (2019).
