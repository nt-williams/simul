> Fast Simultaneous Confidence Bands Based on the Efficient Influence
> Function and Multiplier Bootstrap

-----

## Installation

You can install simul from [GitHub](https://github.com) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("nt-williams/simul")
```

## Scope

Compute fast critical values for constructing uniform (simultaneous)
confidence bands. The critical value is calculated using a multiplier
bootstrap of the empirical efficient influence function as described by
Kennedy (2019).
