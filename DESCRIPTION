Description: Compute critical values for constructing uniform (simultaneous) confidence bands.
  The critical value is calculated using a multiplier bootstrap of the empirical efficient influence function 
  as described by Kennedy (2019) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2017.1422737>. The multiplier bootstrap does not require 
  resampling of the data but only simulation of the multipliers and is thus computationally efficient.
